# User Events Visibility Fix

## Problem
User-created events were not appearing on the map due to radius filtering. The backend was excluding user events that were outside the default 150km radius from the user's location.

## Root Cause
1. **Backend radius filtering**: The backend was applying strict radius filtering that excluded user events outside the specified radius
2. **Frontend default radius**: The frontend used a 150km default radius, but user events were located 166km away from the center point
3. **Missing user event inclusion**: The backend didn't have logic to always include events created by the authenticated user

## Solution

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Modified Events Route (`backend/routes/events.js`)
- **Added optional authentication**: Applied `optionalAuth` middleware to the main events route
- **Enhanced radius filtering logic**: Modified the SQL query to always include events created by the authenticated user, regardless of radius
- **Added debugging**: Added console logs to track authentication and radius filtering

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Only radius filtering
query += ` AND (distance_calculation) <= radius`;

// After: Include user events OR radius filtering
query += ` AND (
  created_by = $currentUserId OR
  (distance_calculation) <= radius
)`;
```

#### 2. Authentication Middleware
- **Optional authentication**: Users can access events without authentication, but authenticated users get their own events included
- **User context**: `req.user` is set when authentication is provided

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Increased Default Radius (`src/context/EventContext.tsx`)
- **Changed default radius**: From 150km to 200km to better accommodate user events
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging for event loading and user event detection

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const [currentRadius, setCurrentRadius] = useState(150)

// After  
const [currentRadius, setCurrentRadius] = useState(200) // Increased to include user events
```

#### 2. Enhanced Event Loading
- **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track user events in loaded data
- **Manual refresh**: Added `refreshEvents` function for manual event reloading
- **Real-time updates**: Enhanced `handleEventCreated` to properly add new events to state

### Testing Results

#### Backend Testing
‚úÖ **Event creation**: Working correctly  
‚úÖ **Event storage**: Working correctly  
‚úÖ **Radius filtering with auth**: User events included regardless of radius  
‚úÖ **Radius filtering without auth**: Only radius-based events included  
‚úÖ **Small radius (10km)**: User events still included when authenticated  

#### Frontend Testing
‚úÖ **Default radius**: Increased to 200km  
‚úÖ **Event loading**: Enhanced with better logging  
‚úÖ **Manual refresh**: Added refresh functionality  
‚úÖ **Real-time updates**: New events added to state immediately  

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Backend radius filtering fix**: User events are now included when authenticated
2. **Frontend default radius increase**: From 150km to 200km
3. **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging and monitoring
4. **Manual refresh functionality**: Users can manually refresh events

### üîÑ In Progress
1. **Frontend app restart**: The user needs to restart the frontend app to see the changes
2. **Testing with real user**: Verify that the user's actual events now appear on the map

## User Instructions

### For the User
1. **Restart the frontend app**: The changes require a frontend restart to take effect
2. **Check event visibility**: User-created events should now appear on the map
3. **Use refresh button**: If events don't appear immediately, use the "Refresh Events" button
4. **Verify permissions**: Edit/Delete buttons should only appear for user's own events

### For Developers
1. **Backend changes deployed**: The API server has been restarted with the new logic
2. **Frontend changes ready**: The frontend code has been updated but needs app restart
3. **Testing completed**: Backend functionality verified with comprehensive tests
4. **Monitoring**: Backend logs show the radius filtering logic is working correctly

## Technical Details

### Backend Logic
```sql
-- New SQL query logic
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
AND (
  created_by = $currentUserId OR  -- Always include user's events
  (
    6371 * acos(...) <= $radius   -- OR include events within radius
  )
)
```

### Frontend Logic
```typescript
// Enhanced event loading with user event detection
const userEvents = processedEvents.filter(event => event.createdBy === currentUserId);
console.log(`üîç Loaded ${processedEvents.length} events, found ${userEvents.length} user events`);
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå User events not visible on map (filtered out by radius)
- ‚ùå Events 166km away excluded by 150km radius
- ‚ùå No way to see user's own events

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ User events always visible when authenticated
- ‚úÖ Events within 200km radius visible
- ‚úÖ Manual refresh available
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates for new events

## Next Steps

1. **User verification**: Confirm that user events now appear on the map
2. **Frontend restart**: Ensure the frontend app is restarted with latest changes
3. **Testing**: Verify that the refresh button works correctly
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for any issues with the new radius filtering logic
