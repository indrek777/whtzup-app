# Location Filtering Crash Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The app was crashing on loading events due to a race condition in the location-based filtering implementation. The issue was:

### **Race Condition**
- Event loading effect was running before location permission check completed
- `locationPermissionGranted` was initially `false` but the effect was treating it as "permission denied"
- This caused the app to try loading events before the location permission flow was complete

### **Symptoms**
- App crashes on startup
- Multiple event loading attempts with different results
- Inconsistent behavior between location permission states

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Proper State Management**
```typescript
// Changed from boolean to undefined | boolean
const [locationPermissionGranted, setLocationPermissionGranted] = useState<boolean | undefined>(undefined)
```

### **2. Enhanced Event Loading Logic**
```typescript
// Check if we have location permission and user location
if (locationPermissionGranted === true && userLocation) {
  // Use 500km radius filtering
  const radiusKm = 500
  console.log(`🎯 Fetching events within ${radiusKm}km of user location`)
  serverEvents = await syncService.fetchEvents(
    { latitude: userLocation[0], longitude: userLocation[1] }, 
    radiusKm
  )
} else if (locationPermissionGranted === false) {
  // Location permission was explicitly denied, load all events
  console.log('📍 Location permission denied, fetching all events')
  serverEvents = await syncService.fetchEvents()
} else {
  // Location permission check is still pending, wait for it to complete
  console.log('⏳ Location permission check pending, skipping event load')
  setIsLoading(false)
  return
}
```

### **3. Improved User Feedback**
```typescript
// Enhanced loading message
<Text style={styles.loadingText}>
  {locationPermissionGranted === undefined 
    ? 'Checking location permission...' 
    : 'Loading events...'
  }
</Text>
```

### **4. Better Logging**
```typescript
console.log('📍 Requesting location permission...')
console.log('✅ Location permission granted, getting user location...')
console.log('⏳ Location permission check pending, skipping event load')
```

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **EventContext Updates**
1. **State Type**: Changed `locationPermissionGranted` from `boolean` to `boolean | undefined`
2. **Interface**: Added `locationPermissionGranted` to `EventContextType`
3. **Logic**: Added explicit checks for `true`, `false`, and `undefined` states
4. **Dependencies**: Event loading effect properly depends on location permission state

### **MapViewNative Updates**
1. **Context**: Added `locationPermissionGranted` to destructured values
2. **Loading State**: Enhanced loading message to show current state
3. **User Experience**: Better feedback during location permission check

## 📊 **Flow Before Fix**
```
1. App starts
2. locationPermissionGranted = false (initial state)
3. Event loading effect runs immediately
4. Treats false as "permission denied"
5. Loads all events
6. Location permission check completes
7. Event loading effect runs again
8. Race condition causes crashes
```

## 📊 **Flow After Fix**
```
1. App starts
2. locationPermissionGranted = undefined (initial state)
3. Event loading effect runs
4. Sees undefined, skips loading, shows "Checking location permission..."
5. Location permission check completes
6. Sets locationPermissionGranted = true/false
7. Event loading effect runs again with proper state
8. Loads events with correct filtering
```

## ✅ **Verification**

### **Test Cases**
- ✅ **Permission Granted**: Events filtered by 500km radius
- ✅ **Permission Denied**: All events loaded as fallback
- ✅ **Permission Pending**: App waits for permission check
- ✅ **No Crashes**: App handles all states gracefully

### **Performance**
- ✅ **No Race Conditions**: Proper state management
- ✅ **Single Event Load**: Events loaded only once per permission state
- ✅ **Fast Response**: Immediate feedback during permission check

## 🎯 **Result**

The app now properly handles the location permission flow without crashes:

1. **Smooth Startup**: No crashes during location permission check
2. **Proper Filtering**: 500km radius filtering works correctly
3. **User Feedback**: Clear loading messages for each state
4. **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling of permission denied scenarios

**The location-based filtering crash has been fixed!** 🚀✨
