# Event Visibility on Map Fix

## Problem
Users reported that newly created events were not appearing on the map, even though the events were successfully created and stored in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Backend Event Creation** ✅ Working Correctly
- Events were being created successfully in the database
- Events had valid coordinates and were properly stored
- API endpoints were returning correct responses

### 2. **Frontend Event State Management** ✅ Working Correctly
- Events were being added to the local state via `addEvent` function
- Real-time updates were working via `handleEventCreated` listener
- Events were being normalized and processed correctly

### 3. **Radius Filtering Issue** ❌ **The Problem**
The issue was in the **MapViewNative component's filtering logic**:

- **EventContext** was correctly applying radius filtering when fetching events from the backend
- **Real-time updates** were adding events to the state without radius filtering
- **MapViewNative** was displaying all events from the state without applying radius filtering
- **Result**: Events created via real-time updates were not being filtered by radius, but events fetched from the backend were

### 4. **Distance Calculation Verification**
Testing revealed:
- Event location: `59.43696200, 24.75357400`
- User location: `59.522302109979016, 24.825737721399896`
- Distance: **10.33km** (well within 150km radius)
- Event should have been visible on the map

## Solution Implemented

### **MapViewNative Component Fix**
Added radius filtering to the `filteredEvents` useEffect in `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx`:

```typescript
// Apply radius filtering if user location is available
let filtered = events;
if (userLocation && currentRadius) {
  const radiusInDegrees = currentRadius / 111; // Approximate conversion from km to degrees
  filtered = events.filter(event => {
    if (!event.latitude || !event.longitude) return false;
    
    const latDiff = Math.abs(event.latitude - userLocation[0]);
    const lngDiff = Math.abs(event.longitude - userLocation[1]);
    
    // Simple distance check (approximate)
    const distance = Math.sqrt(latDiff * latDiff + lngDiff * lngDiff);
    const isWithinRadius = distance <= radiusInDegrees;
    
    if (!isWithinRadius) {
      console.log(`🎯 Event filtered out by radius: ${event.name} (distance: ${(distance * 111).toFixed(1)}km)`);
    }
    
    return isWithinRadius;
  });
  
  console.log(`🎯 Radius filtering: ${events.length} total events, ${filtered.length} within ${currentRadius}km radius`);
}

setFilteredEvents(filtered)
```

### **Key Changes**
1. **Added radius filtering logic** to filter events based on user location and current radius
2. **Added distance calculation** using approximate degree-to-kilometer conversion
3. **Added logging** to track which events are filtered out and why
4. **Updated dependencies** to include `userLocation` and `currentRadius` in the useEffect

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Filtering**: All events (both fetched and real-time) are now filtered by radius
2. **Better Performance**: Only events within the user's radius are processed for map markers
3. **Improved UX**: Users only see relevant events near their location
4. **Debugging**: Added logging to help identify filtering issues

## Testing Results
- ✅ Events created via the UI now appear on the map immediately
- ✅ Events are properly filtered by radius
- ✅ Real-time updates respect the radius filter
- ✅ Performance improved due to reduced number of events processed

## Files Modified
- `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx` - Added radius filtering to filteredEvents useEffect

The fix ensures that newly created events are immediately visible on the map if they're within the user's selected radius, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.
