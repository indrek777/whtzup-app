# Radius Change Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The radius adjustment feature was not working properly - when users changed the search radius, the app would update the `currentRadius` state but would not reload events with the new radius. This meant users would see the radius change in the UI but the map would still show the same events.

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The `loadEvents` function in `EventContext.tsx` was only triggered when `locationPermissionGranted` or `userLocation` changed, but not when `currentRadius` changed. Additionally, the logic was always using the smart radius calculation instead of respecting the user's preferred radius.

## 🔧 **Fix Implemented**

### **1. Updated Event Loading Dependencies**
```typescript
// Added currentRadius to the dependency array
}, [locationPermissionGranted, userLocation, currentRadius])
```

### **2. Modified Radius Logic**
```typescript
// Use user's preferred radius or calculate smart radius
const radiusToUse = currentRadius !== 150 ? currentRadius : calculateSmartRadius(userLocation)
console.log(`🎯 Loading events: Using ${radiusToUse}km radius for user at ${userLocation[0]}, ${userLocation[1]}`)

result = await syncService.fetchEventsProgressive(
  { latitude: userLocation[0], longitude: userLocation[1] }, 
  radiusToUse
)
```

### **3. Improved Smart Radius Calculation**
```typescript
// Only set currentRadius if it's still the default (150)
if (currentRadius === 150) {
  setCurrentRadius(city.radius)
}
```

### **4. Enhanced User Feedback**
```typescript
// Added loading indicator to radius info
<Text style={styles.locationInfoText}>
  📍 {currentRadius}km radius • {events.length} events
  {isLoading && ' • Loading...'}
</Text>

// Added debug logging for radius changes
{ text: '50km (Local)', onPress: () => {
  console.log('🎯 User changed radius to 50km')
  setCurrentRadius(50)
}},
```

## 🎉 **Benefits**

1. **Immediate Response**: Events now reload immediately when radius is changed
2. **User Control**: Users can override the smart radius calculation with their preferred radius
3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicator shows when events are being reloaded
4. **Debug Logging**: Better visibility into radius changes for troubleshooting
5. **Preserved Smart Logic**: Smart radius calculation still works for new users

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

1. **Initial Load**: Uses smart radius calculation based on location
2. **User Changes Radius**: Immediately triggers event reload with new radius
3. **Loading State**: Shows "Loading..." indicator during reload
4. **Updated Map**: Displays events within the new radius
5. **Persistent Preference**: User's radius choice is maintained

## 📱 **User Experience**

- **50km**: Local events only (fast loading, fewer events)
- **100km**: Regional coverage (balanced performance)
- **200km**: Wide area coverage (more events, slower loading)
- **300km**: Very wide coverage (maximum events, slowest loading)

The radius change now works seamlessly with immediate visual feedback and proper event reloading.
