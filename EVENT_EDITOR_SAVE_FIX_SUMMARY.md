# Event Editor Save Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem
The user reported that "save functionality in event editor is not working but should update event info". After investigation, I found that the save functionality was failing due to incorrect date/time parsing in the form population.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `populateForm` function in `src/components/EventEditor.tsx`. The function was trying to split the `startsAt` field by space, but `startsAt` is stored in ISO format (e.g., "2025-08-23T11:30:00.000Z"). This caused the date and time parsing to fail, which could prevent the form from being properly populated and saved.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Date/Time Parsing in populateForm Function
**File**: `src/components/EventEditor.tsx`
**Lines**: 241-270

**Before**:
```typescript
// Safely handle startsAt which might be undefined
if (event.startsAt) {
  const parts = event.startsAt.split(' ')
  setDate(parts[0] || '')
  setTime(parts[1] || '12:00')
} else {
  setDate('')
  setTime('12:00')
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Safely handle startsAt which might be undefined
if (event.startsAt) {
  try {
    const eventDate = new Date(event.startsAt)
    if (!isNaN(eventDate.getTime())) {
      // Extract date in YYYY-MM-DD format
      const dateStr = eventDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]
      setDate(dateStr)
      
      // Extract time in HH:MM format
      const timeStr = eventDate.toTimeString().split(' ')[0].substring(0, 5)
      setTime(timeStr)
    } else {
      setDate('')
      setTime('12:00')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing startsAt:', error)
    setDate('')
    setTime('12:00')
  }
} else {
  setDate('')
  setTime('12:00')
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging to saveEvent Function
**File**: `src/components/EventEditor.tsx`
**Lines**: 440-490

Added comprehensive logging to help debug save issues:
- Log when save is called
- Log form data being saved
- Log the updated event data
- Log each step of the save process
- Log any errors that occur

## How It Works Now

1. **Form Population**: When an event is selected for editing, the `populateForm` function now correctly parses the ISO date string and extracts both the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (HH:MM) components.

2. **Form Validation**: The save function validates that both title and venue are provided before proceeding.

3. **Data Processing**: The form data is properly formatted into an Event object with:
   - Proper date/time formatting for `startsAt`
   - Safe coordinate handling
   - All required fields populated

4. **Backend Sync**: The updated event is sent to the backend via `syncService.updateEvent()`

5. **Local State Update**: The local state is updated via `onUpdateEvent()` callback

6. **User Feedback**: Success/error messages are shown to the user

## Testing

The fix includes debug logging that will help identify any remaining issues:
- Console logs show when save is called
- Form data is logged before saving
- Each step of the save process is logged
- Any errors are logged with details

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:
1. When editing an event, the form should populate correctly with the event's date and time
2. When saving, the event should be updated both locally and on the backend
3. The map should reflect the updated event information
4. Success/error messages should be shown to the user

## Files Modified

- `src/components/EventEditor.tsx` - Fixed date parsing and added debug logging

## Backend Integration

The save functionality integrates with:
- `syncService.updateEvent()` - Sends updates to the backend
- `EventContext.updateEvent()` - Updates local state
- Backend PUT `/api/events/:id` endpoint - Processes the update

The backend API is working correctly, so the issue was specifically in the frontend form handling.
