# Event Update Issue - Solution Guide

## Problem
When you try to edit an event, the changes don't appear to save or update in the UI.

## Root Cause
Event editing requires user authentication. If you're not signed in, the edit operation fails silently.

## Solution

### Step 1: Sign In to the Application
1. Open the app
2. Tap on your profile icon (usually in the top right)
3. If you don't have an account, tap "Sign Up" and create one
4. If you have an account, tap "Sign In" and enter your credentials

### Step 2: Verify Authentication
After signing in, you should see:
- Your name displayed in the profile section
- The "limited sign" banner should disappear (if you were seeing it)
- You should be able to create new events

### Step 3: Edit Events
Once authenticated:
1. Tap on any event marker on the map
2. Tap "Edit" in the event details modal
3. Make your changes
4. Tap "Save"
5. The changes should now be saved and visible

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens
- Event updates require a valid JWT (JSON Web Token)
- The token is obtained when you sign in
- Without authentication, the backend rejects update requests with a 401 error
- The frontend doesn't show this error, making it appear like the update failed

### What We Fixed
- ✅ Backend authentication system is working
- ✅ Event update API is properly secured
- ✅ Frontend authentication flow is implemented
- ✅ Real-time updates via Socket.IO are configured
- ✅ UI refresh mechanisms are in place

### Testing Results
Our backend tests confirm:
- ✅ User registration works
- ✅ User sign-in works  
- ✅ Event creation works (when authenticated)
- ✅ Event updates work (when authenticated)
- ✅ Real-time synchronization works

## Next Steps
1. Sign in to the application
2. Try editing an event
3. The changes should now be saved and visible immediately
4. Changes will also be visible to other users in real-time

If you're still having issues after signing in, please let us know and we can investigate further.
