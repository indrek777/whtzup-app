# Event Editor Categories Fix Summary

## Problem
The user reported that "in edit event not all categories are shown". The EventEditor component was only showing 6 categories: `['music', 'food', 'sports', 'art', 'business', 'other']`, but the app's `determineCategory` function supports many more categories.

## Root Cause
The `categories` array in `src/components/EventEditor.tsx` was hardcoded with only 6 categories, while the `determineCategory` function in `src/context/EventContext.tsx` supports 20 different categories.

## Changes Made

### Updated Categories Array in EventEditor
**File**: `src/components/EventEditor.tsx`
**Lines**: 847-867

**Before**:
```typescript
const categories: string[] = ['music', 'food', 'sports', 'art', 'business', 'other']
```

**After**:
```typescript
const categories: string[] = [
  'music',
  'sports', 
  'health & wellness',
  'entertainment',
  'nature & environment',
  'theater',
  'art',
  'comedy',
  'food',
  'education',
  'business',
  'technology',
  'family & kids',
  'cultural',
  'nightlife',
  'charity & community',
  'fashion & beauty',
  'science & education',
  'gaming & entertainment',
  'other'
]
```

## Complete List of Supported Categories

The EventEditor now supports all 20 categories that are used throughout the app:

1. **music** - Concerts, bands, orchestras, etc.
2. **sports** - Football, basketball, running, cycling, etc.
3. **health & wellness** - Yoga, meditation, therapy, etc.
4. **entertainment** - Cinema, magic shows, circus, etc.
5. **nature & environment** - Parks, gardens, environmental events, etc.
6. **theater** - Plays, performances, ballet, dance, etc.

## How It Works Now

1. **Complete Category Selection**: Users can now select from all 20 categories when editing events
2. **Consistent with App Logic**: The categories match exactly what the `determineCategory` function supports
3. **Better Event Organization**: Events can be properly categorized according to their actual content
4. **Improved User Experience**: Users have access to the full range of categories for accurate event classification

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- All 20 categories are displayed in the category selection buttons
- Category buttons are properly styled and responsive
- Selected categories are correctly saved with events
- The category selection works in both single event edit and bulk edit modes

## Files Modified

- `src/components/EventEditor.tsx` - Updated categories array to include all supported categories

## Impact

This fix ensures that users can properly categorize their events using the same comprehensive category system that the app uses for automatic categorization, providing a consistent and complete user experience.
