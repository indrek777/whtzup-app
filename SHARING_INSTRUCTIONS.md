# 🚀 Automatic Event Sharing for All Users

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

When you import CSV events, the system now:
1. ✅ **Saves locally** - Events are stored in your browser's localStorage
2. ✅ **Updates server** - Automatically updates the server's JSON file
3. ✅ **Shares instantly** - All users on the same server see new events immediately

## 📋 **Automatic Sharing Process:**

### 1. **Import Your CSV File**
- Go to Settings → Import (password: `indrek`)
- Upload your CSV file
- Complete the import process
- **Events are automatically shared with all users!**

### 2. **All Users See Events Instantly**
- ✅ **No manual steps required**
- ✅ **No file replacement needed**
- ✅ **All users on the same server see new events immediately**
- ✅ **Works for both new and existing users**

## 🔧 **Manual Download (Alternative)**

If you want to download the current events at any time:
1. Go to Settings → Download button (password: `indrek`)
2. This downloads all current events (including imported ones)
3. Replace the `events-user.json` file with this downloaded file

## 📁 **File Structure**

```
public/
├── events-user.json          # Main events file (replace this)
├── events-user-backup.json   # Backup of original events
└── events-user-updated-*.json # Downloaded files from imports
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- **Backup first**: Always keep a backup of the original `events-user.json`
- **Test locally**: Test the new file locally before deploying
- **Clear cache**: Users may need to clear their browser storage to see new events
- **File format**: Ensure the JSON file maintains the correct format

## 🚀 **Deployment**

After replacing the JSON file:
1. **Deploy** your updated app
2. **All new users** will see the imported events
3. **Existing users** can clear their storage to see new events, or they'll see them on new devices

## 🔄 **For Existing Users**

If existing users want to see the new shared events:
1. Go to Settings → Clear All Events (password: `indrek`)
2. Refresh the page
3. The app will load the updated events from the JSON file

**This system ensures that imported events can be shared across all users while maintaining local storage for individual users.**
