console.log('')
console.log('Based on your description, the issue is:')
console.log('- User is signed in and subscribed')
console.log('- User can edit event category')
console.log('- Update appears to succeed')
console.log('- But changes are not reflected on map')
console.log('- When reopening the same event, nothing has changed')
console.log('')
console.log('This suggests one of these issues:')
console.log('')
console.log('1. üîê AUTHENTICATION ISSUE:')
console.log('   - User might not be properly authenticated in frontend')
console.log('   - JWT token might be expired or invalid')
console.log('   - Frontend might be using stale authentication state')
console.log('')
console.log('2. üîÑ UI REFRESH ISSUE:')
console.log('   - Events state is not being updated after successful backend update')
console.log('   - Markers are not re-rendering with new category')
console.log('   - Event details modal is not refreshing with new data')
console.log('')
console.log('3. üéØ PERMISSION ISSUE:')
console.log('   - User might not have permission to edit this specific event')
console.log('   - Event might be created by another user')
console.log('   - Subscription status might not be properly recognized')
console.log('')
console.log('4. üì° SYNC ISSUE:')
console.log('   - Backend update might be failing silently')
console.log('   - Frontend might be using cached data')
console.log('   - Real-time updates might not be working')
console.log('')
console.log('DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:')
console.log('')
console.log('1. Check if user is properly authenticated:')
console.log('   - Open UserProfile modal')
console.log('   - Verify user name is displayed')
console.log('   - Check if "limited sign" banner is gone')
console.log('')
console.log('2. Check subscription status:')
console.log('   - In UserProfile, verify subscription shows "Premium"')
console.log('   - Check if premium features are available')
console.log('')
console.log('3. Test with a simple event:')
console.log('   - Create a new event')
console.log('   - Try to edit that event (should work)')
console.log('   - If it works, the issue is with existing events')
console.log('')
console.log('4. Check console logs:')
console.log('   - Look for "Event updated successfully" message')
console.log('   - Look for "Refreshed X events from server" message')
console.log('   - Look for any error messages')
console.log('')
console.log('5. Test manual refresh:')
console.log('   - Use the refresh button (üîÑ) on the map')
console.log('   - Check if the event updates after manual refresh')
console.log('')
console.log('LIKELY SOLUTION:')
console.log('')
console.log('The most likely issue is that the user is trying to edit an event')
console.log('created by someone else, and the permission check is failing silently.')
console.log('')
console.log('To fix this:')
console.log('1. Ensure user has premium subscription')
console.log('2. Check if the event was created by the current user')
console.log('3. Try creating and editing your own event first')
console.log('4. Check console logs for permission errors')
console.log('')
console.log('If the issue persists, please provide:')
console.log('- Console logs from the browser/device')
console.log('- Whether the user created the event or not')
console.log('- The exact steps taken to reproduce the issue')
