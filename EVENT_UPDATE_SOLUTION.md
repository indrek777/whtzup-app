# Event Update Issue - Complete Solution Guide

## Problem Description
User is signed in and subscribed, but when they edit an event's category, the changes are not reflected on the map or when reopening the event.

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely causes are:

### 1. **Permission Issue (Most Likely)**
- User is trying to edit an event created by another user
- Even with premium subscription, there might be a permission check failing
- The update appears to succeed but actually fails silently

### 2. **Authentication State Issue**
- Frontend authentication state might be stale
- JWT token might be expired
- User might not be properly authenticated in the frontend

### 3. **UI Refresh Issue**
- Events state is not being updated after successful backend update
- Markers are not re-rendering with new category
- Event details modal is not refreshing with new data

## Immediate Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Authentication
1. Open the UserProfile modal
2. Check if your name is displayed
3. Verify that the "limited sign" banner is gone
4. Check if you can create new events

### Step 2: Check Subscription Status
1. In UserProfile, verify subscription shows "Premium"
2. Check if premium features are available
3. Try accessing premium-only features

### Step 3: Test with Your Own Event
1. Create a new event using the "+" button
2. Try to edit that event's category
3. If this works, the issue is with existing events

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
Look for these messages in the browser/device console:
- ✅ "Event updated successfully"
- ✅ "Refreshed X events from server"
- ❌ Any error messages about permissions or authentication

### Step 5: Test Manual Refresh
1. Use the refresh button (🔄) on the map
2. Check if the event updates after manual refresh
3. If it updates, the issue is with automatic refresh

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Permission Issue
If the user is trying to edit someone else's event:

1. **Ensure Premium Subscription is Active**
   - Check subscription status in UserProfile
   - If not premium, upgrade subscription

2. **Check Event Ownership**
   - Only edit events you created
   - Or ensure you have premium subscription to edit any event

3. **Create Your Own Event**
   - Create a new event
   - Edit that event instead

### Solution 2: Fix Authentication Issue
If authentication is the problem:

1. **Sign Out and Sign Back In**
   - Open UserProfile
   - Sign out
   - Sign back in with your credentials

2. **Clear App Data**
   - Clear browser cache/storage
   - Restart the app

3. **Check Token Expiration**
   - JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes
   - Try refreshing the page or restarting the app

### Solution 3: Fix UI Refresh Issue
If the UI is not updating:

1. **Use Manual Refresh**
   - Tap the refresh button (🔄) on the map
   - This forces a fresh fetch from the server

2. **Close and Reopen Event**
   - Close the event details modal
   - Tap the event marker again
   - Check if the updated data appears

3. **Restart the App**
   - Close the app completely
   - Reopen and try again

## Technical Debugging

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these patterns in the backend logs:
- Event update requests
- Permission check results
- Authentication failures

### Check Frontend State
The frontend should show these console logs:
```
🔄 Event updated successfully, refreshing data...
🔄 Refreshed X events from server after update
🔄 Updating events state with fresh data...
✅ Events state updated
```

### Check Network Requests
In browser dev tools, check:
- PUT request to `/api/events/{id}` - should return 200
- GET request to `/api/events` - should show updated data
- Authentication headers are present

## Prevention

### For Users
1. Always ensure you're signed in before editing events
2. Check your subscription status regularly
3. Only edit events you created (unless you have premium)
4. Use the manual refresh button if updates don't appear

### For Developers
1. Add better error handling for permission failures
2. Show clear error messages when updates fail
3. Implement automatic token refresh
4. Add visual feedback for successful updates

## Next Steps

If the issue persists after trying these solutions:

1. **Provide Console Logs**
   - Share any error messages from the browser/device console
   - Include network request logs

2. **Describe the Exact Steps**
   - What event you're trying to edit
   - Whether you created the event or not
   - Your subscription status

3. **Test with Different Events**
   - Try editing different events
   - Try creating and editing your own event
   - Check if the issue is specific to certain events

## Expected Behavior

After a successful event update:
1. ✅ Success message appears
2. ✅ Map markers update with new category icon/color
3. ✅ Event details show updated information
4. ✅ Changes are visible to other users
5. ✅ Changes persist after app restart

If any of these don't happen, there's an issue that needs to be investigated further.
