# Duplicate Event Handling Fix

## Problem
The event creation functionality was not working properly when users tried to create events with the same name and venue. The backend was returning a 200 OK status with `isDuplicate: true` instead of a proper error status, which confused the frontend into thinking the event was created successfully.

### Symptoms
- Backend logs showed: "Event already exists, returning existing event"
- Frontend logs showed: "Event created successfully" 
- Users were confused because they expected either a new event or a clear error message
- The response format was inconsistent with REST API best practices

## Root Cause
In `backend/routes/events.js`, the duplicate event check was returning a 200 OK status:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (problematic)
if (existingResult.rows.length > 0) {
  return res.status(200).json({
    success: true,
    data: transformEventFields(existingEvent),
    message: 'Event already exists',
    deviceId,
    isDuplicate: true
  });
}
```

This violated HTTP status code conventions where 200 OK should indicate successful creation, not a conflict.

## Solution

### 1. Backend Fix (`backend/routes/events.js`)
Changed the duplicate event response to return a proper 409 Conflict status:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (fixed)
if (existingResult.rows.length > 0) {
  return res.status(409).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Event already exists',
    details: 'An event with this name and venue already exists',
    data: transformEventFields(existingEvent),
    deviceId
  });
}
```

### 2. Frontend Error Handling (`src/utils/syncService.ts`)
Updated the `makeApiCall` method to provide a user-friendly error message for 409 status codes:

```javascript
// Added specific handling for 409 Conflict
} else if (response.status === 409) {
  errorMessage = 'An event with this name and venue already exists.';
}
```

### 3. Frontend Response Handling (`src/utils/syncService.ts`)
Removed the confusing `isDuplicate` handling logic from the `createEvent` method since the backend now properly throws an error for duplicates.

## Benefits
1. **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: 409 Conflict correctly indicates a resource conflict
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get specific feedback about why their event creation failed
3. **Consistent API Design**: Follows REST API best practices
4. **Better User Experience**: No more confusing "success" messages for failed operations
5. **Error Handler Integration**: Duplicate events are now properly categorized as validation errors

## Testing
The fix was verified with a test script that:
1. Creates a user account
2. Creates an event successfully (201 Created)
3. Attempts to create the same event again
4. Verifies that a 409 Conflict error is returned with proper error details

## Error Flow
1. User attempts to create duplicate event
2. Backend checks for existing event with same name/venue
3. Backend returns 409 Conflict with error details
4. Frontend `makeApiCall` catches the error and provides user-friendly message
5. Error handler categorizes it as a validation error
6. User sees clear error message: "An event with this name and venue already exists."

## Files Modified
- `backend/routes/events.js` - Changed duplicate event response from 200 OK to 409 Conflict
- `src/utils/syncService.ts` - Added 409 status code handling and removed confusing duplicate logic
- `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Already had proper 409 error mapping (no changes needed)

The fix ensures that event creation now works as expected, with proper error handling for duplicate events.
