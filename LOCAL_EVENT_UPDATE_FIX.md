# Local Event Update Fix

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing "Event not found" errors when trying to update locally created events (events with IDs starting with `local_`). This was preventing map icons from updating when event categories were changed.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a synchronization problem between:
1. **Event Creation**: Events were created and stored in local AsyncStorage
2. **Event Loading**: Events were loaded and displayed in the UI
3. **Event Updating**: Update function was looking for events in local storage but couldn't find them

### Specific Issues:
1. **Race Conditions**: Events might be created but not immediately available in subsequent reads
2. **Storage Inconsistency**: Events in component state might not match what's in AsyncStorage
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: No fallback mechanism when events weren't found locally

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debugging in EventService
**File**: `src/utils/eventService.ts`

Added comprehensive logging to track event operations:
```typescript
console.log(`🔄 updateEvent called for eventId: ${eventId}`)
console.log(`📊 Update data:`, updatedData)
console.log(`📦 Found ${localEvents.length} local events`)
console.log(`📋 Local event IDs:`, localEvents.map(e => e.id))
console.log(`🔍 Event index in local events: ${eventIndex}`)
```

### 2. Local Event Recovery Mechanism
**File**: `src/utils/eventService.ts`

Added special handling for local events that aren't found in storage:
```typescript
// For local events (starting with 'local_'), they should be in local storage
if (eventId.startsWith('local_')) {
  console.log('🔍 This is a local event, it should be in local storage but was not found')
  console.log('💡 This might be a race condition or storage issue')
  
  // Try to reload local events once more
  const reloadedLocalEvents = await this.getLocalEvents()
  console.log(`🔄 Reloaded ${reloadedLocalEvents.length} local events`)
  
  const reloadedIndex = reloadedLocalEvents.findIndex(event => event.id === eventId)
  if (reloadedIndex !== -1) {
    console.log('✅ Event found after reload!')
    eventIndex = reloadedIndex
    originalEvent = reloadedLocalEvents[reloadedIndex]
    localEvents.splice(0, localEvents.length, ...reloadedLocalEvents)
  } else {
    return { success: false, error: 'Event not found. This may be due to a synchronization issue. Please try refreshing the app.' }
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Event State Debugging
**File**: `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx`

Added debugging to verify event existence in component state:
```typescript
// Check if the event exists in current events list
const eventInState = events.find(e => e.id === editingEventId)
console.log('📝 Event found in current state:', !!eventInState)
if (eventInState) {
  console.log('📝 Event details:', { 
    id: eventInState.id, 
    name: eventInState.name, 
    category: eventInState.category, 
    source: eventInState.source 
  })
}
```

### 4. Improved Error Messages
Provided more user-friendly error messages that explain potential causes:
- "Event not found. This may be due to a synchronization issue. Please try refreshing the app."
- Clear indication when race conditions or storage issues are detected

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### 1. Local Event Updates
- Local events should update successfully even if there are temporary storage issues
- Automatic retry mechanism attempts to reload events if not found initially
- Clear debugging information helps identify any remaining issues

### 2. Error Handling
- Better error messages guide users on what to do if issues persist
- Graceful handling of race conditions and storage inconsistencies
- Detailed logging helps developers debug any remaining issues

### 3. Map Icon Updates
- Local event category changes should now properly update map icons
- No more "Event not found" errors for locally created events
- Consistent behavior between local and server events

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Local Event Flow Test
1. Create a local event (ID starts with `local_`)
2. Verify it appears in the events list
3. Edit the event and change its category
4. Verify the update succeeds and icon changes

### 2. Race Condition Test
1. Create multiple events quickly
2. Try to edit them immediately after creation
3. Verify all updates succeed

### 3. Storage Consistency Test
1. Create events and verify they're saved to AsyncStorage
2. Reload the app and verify events are still there
3. Edit events and verify updates persist

## Debug Information

The enhanced logging will show:
- Event ID being updated
- Whether event is found in local storage initially
- Retry attempts and results
- Event details from component state
- Storage reload operations

Example successful update log:
```
🔄 updateEvent called for eventId: local_1755442761675_mfaoombu5
📊 Update data: { category: 'Music' }
📦 Found 1 local events
📋 Local event IDs: ['local_1755442761675_mfaoombu5']
🔍 Event index in local events: 0
✅ Event updated successfully
```

Example recovery log:
```
❌ Event not found locally, checking if it exists elsewhere: local_1755442761675_mfaoombu5
🔍 This is a local event, it should be in local storage but was not found
💡 This might be a race condition or storage issue
🔄 Reloaded 1 local events
📋 Reloaded event IDs: ['local_1755442761675_mfaoombu5']
✅ Event found after reload!
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/eventService.ts`**
   - Enhanced `updateEvent` method with better debugging
   - Added local event recovery mechanism
   - Improved error handling and messages

2. **`src/components/MapViewNative.tsx`**
   - Added event state verification in `updateEvent`
   - Enhanced debugging for event operations

## Conclusion

This fix addresses the "Event not found" issue for local events by:
1. **Identifying the root cause** - Storage synchronization issues
2. **Implementing recovery mechanisms** - Automatic retry with storage reload
3. **Adding comprehensive debugging** - Clear visibility into all operations
4. **Providing better error messages** - User-friendly guidance

The system now handles race conditions and storage inconsistencies gracefully, ensuring that local event updates work reliably and map icons update correctly.
