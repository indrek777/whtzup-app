# Event Update Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that when they press "update event", it says "successful" but the edit event screen stays on and shows old info.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `updateEvent` function in `MapViewNative.tsx`. The form reset code and modal closing logic were placed outside the success block, which meant they would execute regardless of whether the update was successful or not. Additionally, the modal closing was only happening in the Alert.alert's onPress callback, which might not execute properly in all cases.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Modal Closing Logic
- **Before**: Modal closing and form reset were only in the Alert.alert onPress callback
- **After**: Modal closes immediately after successful update, before showing the Alert
- **Location**: `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx` lines ~2290-2320

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Added detailed console logs to track the update process
- Added logging for result type, keys, success value, and error value
- Added logging for modal closing and form reset operations

### 3. Added Fallback Mechanisms
- Added a 1-second timeout fallback to force modal close
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Update is Successful:
1. ✅ Event is updated in backend
2. ✅ Events are refreshed from server
3. ✅ Modal closes immediately
4. ✅ Form is reset
5. ✅ Success alert is shown
6. ✅ Map markers refresh with new data
7. ✅ Event details modal shows updated information

### When Update Fails:
1. ❌ Modal stays open
2. ❌ Form is not reset
3. ❌ Error alert is shown
4. ❌ No changes are made

## Console Logs to Look For

When testing the fix, you should see these console logs:

```
🔄 Starting event update...
📝 Event ID: [event-id]
📝 New category: [category]
📊 Event update result: { success: true }
📊 Result type: object
📊 Result keys: ['success']
📊 Success value: true
📊 Error value: undefined
🔄 Event updated successfully, refreshing data...
🔄 Refreshed [X] events from server after update
✅ Events state updated
🔄 Closing modal immediately after successful update...
🔄 Resetting form immediately...
✅ Success alert OK button pressed
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Sign in to the app**
2. **Find an event you created or have permission to edit**
3. **Tap on the event to open details**
4. **Tap "Edit" button**
5. **Make changes to the event (e.g., change category, name, description)**
6. **Tap "Update Event"**
7. **Verify the modal closes immediately**
8. **Verify the success alert appears**
9. **Verify the event shows updated information when you tap it again**

## If Issue Persists

If the modal still doesn't close after the fix:

1. **Check console logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify the user is authenticated** and has permission to edit the event
3. **Check if the backend is responding** properly
4. **Try refreshing the app** and testing again
