# Marker Category Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Users were not seeing category-based icons on map markers. All events were showing the generic ⭐ icon instead of category-specific icons like 💚 for health & wellness, 🏃 for sports, etc.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `determineCategory` function in `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx`. The function was not properly categorizing events, causing most events to fall back to the "other" category, which displays the generic ⭐ icon.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Category Determination Logic
- **Added specific keyword matching** for outdoor activities that were previously being categorized as "other"
- **Improved condition ordering** to ensure music-related outdoor activities are correctly categorized
- **Added comprehensive debug logging** to track category determination

### 2. Specific Categories Added/Improved
The following event types now have proper category mapping:

| Event Type | Category | Icon | Example Events |
|------------|----------|------|----------------|
| Beach Yoga | health & wellness | 💚 | "Beach Yoga Session" |
| Wildlife Watching | nature & environment | 🌿 | "Wildlife Watching Tour" |
| Water Sports | sports | 🏃 | "Stand-up Paddleboarding", "Kayaking Adventure" |
| Cultural Events | cultural | 🎭 | "Cultural Festival", "Historical Tour" |
| Outdoor Music | entertainment | 🎵 | "Outdoor Music Session" |
| Creative Activities | entertainment | 🎨 | "Urban Sketching Workshop" |
| Nature Activities | nature & environment | 🌿 | "Tide Pool Exploration" |
| Adventure Sports | sports | 🏃 | "Rock Climbing", "Surfing Lessons" |
| Leisure Activities | entertainment | 🎵 | "Sunset Watching", "Park Picnic" |
| Extreme Sports | sports | 🏃 | "Mountaineering Trip", "Wilderness Camping" |

### 3. Debug Logging Added
- Added `console.log` statements with 🎯 prefix to track category determination
- Logs show when events are successfully categorized vs. falling back to "other"
- Helps identify any remaining categorization issues

## Test Results
Created and ran `test-category-determination.js` to verify fixes:

```

## Expected Category-Icon Mappings
Based on the `getMarkerIcon` function, events should now display:

- **health & wellness** → 💚 (green heart)
- **sports** → 🏃 (running person)
- **nature & environment** → 🌿 (leaf)
- **cultural** → 🎭 (performing arts)
- **entertainment** → 🎵 (musical note)
- **music** → 🎵 (musical note)
- **art** → 🎨 (artist palette)
- **food** → 🍕 (pizza)
- **education** → 📚 (books)
- **business** → 💼 (briefcase)
- **technology** → 💻 (laptop)
- **family & kids** → 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family)
- **nightlife** → 🍸 (cocktail)
- **charity & community** → 🤝 (handshake)
- **fashion & beauty** → 👗 (dress)
- **science & education** → 🔬 (microscope)
- **gaming & entertainment** → 🎮 (game controller)
- **other** → ⭐ (star) - fallback for uncategorized events

## Next Steps for User
1. **Restart the app** to see the updated category determination in action
2. **Check console logs** for the new 🎯 prefixed category determination messages
3. **Look for category-specific icons** on the map instead of generic ⭐ icons
4. **Verify that events** like "Beach Yoga" now show 💚 instead of ⭐

## Files Modified
- `src/components/MapViewNative.tsx` - Enhanced `determineCategory` function
- `test-category-determination.js` - Created test script to verify fixes
- `MARKER_CATEGORY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact from enhanced category determination
- Debug logging can be removed in production if needed
- Existing performance optimizations remain intact

## Troubleshooting
If users still don't see category-specific icons:
1. Check console logs for 🎯 messages
2. Verify that events have proper names/descriptions
3. Ensure the app has been restarted after the changes
4. Check that the `getMarkerIcon` function is properly mapping categories to icons
