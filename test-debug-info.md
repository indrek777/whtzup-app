# Debug Guide: Event Icon Update Issue

## Problem
Icons are not changing even for the user who edits the event.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you edit an event, look for these console logs:

```
🔄 Starting event update...
📝 Event ID: [event-id]
📝 New category: [new-category]
📝 Current events count: [number]

🔄 Event updated successfully, refreshing data...
🔄 Refreshed [number] events from server after update
🔄 Updating events state with fresh data...
📊 Fresh events: [array of events with categories]
✅ Events state updated

🔄 MemoizedClusters useMemo triggered - filteredEvents changed!
🎯 Creating clusters from [number] filtered events
🎯 Created [number] clusters

🔄 MemoizedMarkers useMemo triggered - events changed!
🎯 Creating markers from [number] clusters
📊 Filtered events for markers: [array of events with categories]
🎯 Created [number] markers
```

### 2. Test Manual Refresh
1. Edit an event and change its category
2. Tap the blue refresh button (🔄) above the "+" button
3. Check if the icon changes

### 3. Test App State Refresh
1. Edit an event and change its category
2. Switch away from the app (press home button)
3. Switch back to the app
4. Check if the icon changes

### 4. Check Event Details Modal
1. Open an event details modal
2. Edit the event category
3. Check if the modal shows the updated category
4. Close and reopen the modal to see if it persists

## Expected Behavior
- Console logs should show the event update process
- Icons should change immediately after edit
- Manual refresh should work
- App state refresh should work
- Event details modal should show updated category

## If Debugging Shows Issues
- If console logs are missing, the update process is not working
- If logs show but icons don't change, the marker rendering is the issue
- If manual refresh works but real-time doesn't, Socket.IO is the issue

## Quick Fix Test
If the issue persists, try this temporary fix:
1. After editing an event, manually tap the refresh button
2. This should force a server refresh and update the icons
