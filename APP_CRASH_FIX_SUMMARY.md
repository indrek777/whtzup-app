# App Crash Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was experiencing frequent crashes and restarts, with the backend container restarting every few seconds. The logs showed database connection pool errors:

```
Error fetching event: Error: Cannot use a pool after calling end on the pool
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Health Check Configuration Issue
The main issue was a **mismatched port configuration** in the health check:

- **Health check** was trying to connect to port **3000**
- **Server** was actually running on port **4000**
- This caused health checks to **fail continuously**
- Failed health checks triggered **container restarts**
- Frequent restarts caused **database pool connection issues**

### 2. Database Pool Management Issues
- **Graceful shutdown** was closing the database pool
- **Container restarts** were happening before shutdown completed
- **Multiple instances** trying to use the same closed pool
- **No proper error handling** for pool closure scenarios

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Health Check Configuration

**File**: `backend/healthcheck.js`
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,  // ❌ Wrong port
  path: '/health',
  method: 'GET',
  timeout: 5000
};

// After (correct)
const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: process.env.PORT || 4000,  // ✅ Correct port
  path: '/health',
  method: 'GET',
  timeout: 5000
};
```

**File**: `backend/Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
# Before (incorrect)
EXPOSE 3000  # ❌ Wrong port

# After (correct)
EXPOSE 4000  # ✅ Correct port
```

### 2. Improved Database Pool Configuration

**File**: `backend/config/database.js`
```javascript
// Enhanced pool configuration
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: false,
  max: 20, // Maximum number of clients in the pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Close idle clients after 30 seconds
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000, // Return an error after 2 seconds if connection could not be established
  maxUses: 7500 // Close (and replace) a connection after it has been used 7500 times
});

// Handle pool errors
pool.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err);
  process.exit(-1);
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Graceful Shutdown Handling

**File**: `backend/server.js`
```javascript
// Improved graceful shutdown with proper state management
let isShuttingDown = false;

process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  if (isShuttingDown) {
    logger.info('Shutdown already in progress, ignoring SIGTERM');
    return;
  }
  
  isShuttingDown = true;
  logger.info('SIGTERM received, shutting down gracefully');
  
  try {
    await pool.end();
    logger.info('Database pool closed gracefully');
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error closing database pool:', error);
  }
  
  // ... Redis shutdown and server close logic
  
  // Force exit after 10 seconds if graceful shutdown fails
  setTimeout(() => {
    logger.error('Forced shutdown after timeout');
    process.exit(1);
  }, 10000);
});
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fixed Health Check Port
- Updated `healthcheck.js` to use port 4000
- Updated `Dockerfile` to expose port 4000
- Rebuilt container image

### 2. Enhanced Database Pool Management
- Added proper pool configuration with limits
- Added error handling for pool events
- Improved connection timeout settings

### 3. Improved Graceful Shutdown
- Added shutdown state tracking
- Added timeout for forced shutdown
- Added proper error handling for pool closure
- Added SIGINT handler for additional signal support

### 4. Container Rebuild and Restart
```bash
# Rebuild the container with fixes
docker-compose build api-server

# Restart with new image
docker-compose up -d api-server
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Container restarting every few seconds
- ❌ Health check failures
- ❌ Database pool errors
- ❌ App crashes and instability

### After Fix
- ✅ Container stable and healthy
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Database connections working properly
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Sync system functioning normally

## Verification

### Container Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Result: Container shows "healthy" status and stable uptime
```

### API Health Check
```bash
curl http://olympio.ee:4000/api/health
# Result: 200 OK with proper response
```

### Sync Endpoint Test
```bash
curl "http://olympio.ee:4000/api/events/updates?since=2025-08-20T09:58:42.011Z&deviceId=test"
# Result: 200 OK with updates data
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Health Check Configuration**: Always ensure health check ports match the actual server port
2. **Database Pool Management**: Proper pool configuration prevents connection issues
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement proper shutdown handling to prevent resource leaks
4. **Container Monitoring**: Monitor container logs and status to identify issues early
5. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for database operations

## Status
✅ **Fixed**: The app is now stable and running without crashes. The frontend-backend synchronization system is working correctly.
